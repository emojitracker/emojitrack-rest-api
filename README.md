### Important note on API usage
**Read this first and be sure you understand it:** When attemping to utilize the
realtime nature of Emojitracker, theREST API should only be used to establish
initial data state, for subsequent updates use the Emojitracker Streaming API.

**IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE POLLING INSTEAD FOR UPDATES, YOU ARE DOING
SOMETHING WRONG AND YOU ARE A BAD PERSON.**
