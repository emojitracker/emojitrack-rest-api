# Emojitracker REST API :dizzy:

This is the main API endpoint for the Emojitracker REST API.

_(Note: in active development! You may wish to wait for a tagged `v1.0` release
before assuming everything is stable.)_

## REST API Specifications

### When to use the REST API

In general, use the REST API to build an initial snapshot state for a page (or
get a one-time use data grab), but then use the [Streaming API][stream-api] to
keep it up to date.

Do not repeatedly poll the REST API.  It is intentionally aggressively cached in
such a way to discourage this, in that the scores will only update at a lower
rate (a few times per minute), meaning you _have_ to use the Streaming API to
get fast realtime data updates.

:rotating_light:
**IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE POLLING FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES, YOU ARE DOING
SOMETHING WRONG AND YOU ARE A BAD PERSON.**

(Note that this is a design decision, not a server performance issue.)

### REST API Endpoints

Production endpoint is: `https://api.emojitracker.com`. All REST endpoints honor
`Accept-Encoding: gzip`. The Emojitracker REST API is lightly versioned
(currently `v1`), and efforts will be made to prevent major breaking changes
without a version change.

#### `GET /v1/rankings`

Returns an array of every emoji in ranked order with scores.

```json
